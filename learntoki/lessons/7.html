Sentences without <span class="textit">mi</span> or <span class="textit">sina</span> as the subject</a>
</h1>
For sentences that don't use <span class="textit">mi</span> or <span class="textit">sina</span> as the subject, there is one small catch that you'll have to learn. 
Look at how <span class="textit">li</span> is used. 
<span class="textbf"><span class="textit">li</span></span> is a grammatical word that <span class="textbf">separates the subject from its verb</span>. 
<span class="textbf">It's only used when the subject is not <span class="textit">mi</span> or <span class="textit">sina</span>.</span> 
Although <span class="textit">li</span> might seem worthless right now, as you continue to learn Toki Pona you will see that some sentences could be very confusing if <span class="textit">li</span> weren't there.

Because of the lacks of "to be", after <span class="textit">li</span> can not only be a verb, it can follow a noun or an adjective as well.
The missing verb "to be" is here marked with an apostrophe.
