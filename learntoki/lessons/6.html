The Lack of the verb "to be"</a>
</h1>
<p>
One of the first principles you'll need to learn about Toki Pona is that there is <span class="textbf">no form of the verb "to be"</span> like there is in English. 
That is why after a <span class="textit">mi</span> or <span class="textit">sina</span> can follow a noun or an adjective also. 
For clarification the missing verb "to be" is here marked with an apostrophe.

<td align="LEFT">&nbsp;</td>
<td align="LEFT">I am food.</td>

<tr><td align="LEFT" valign="TOP" width="142">sina pona.</td>
<td align="LEFT">&nbsp;</td>
<td align="LEFT">You fix.</td>

<tr><td align="LEFT" valign="TOP" width="142">sina ' pona.</td>
<td align="LEFT">&nbsp;</td>
<td align="LEFT">You are good.</td>

Because Toki Pona lacks "to be", <span class="textbf">the exact meaning is lost</span>. 
<span class="textit">moku</span> in this sentence could be a verb, or it could be a noun; just as <span class="textit">pona</span> could be an adjective or could be a verb. 
In situations such as these, the listener must rely on context. 
After all, how often do you hear someone say "I am food"? 
I hope not very often! You can be fairly certain that <span class="textit">mi moku</span> means "I'm eating".
