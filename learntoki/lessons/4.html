The Ambiguity of Toki Pona</a>
</h1>
Do you see how several of <span class="textbf">the words</span> in the vocabulary <span class="textbf">have multiple meanings</span>? 
For example, <span class="textit">suli</span> can mean either "long" or "tall" or "big" or "important". 
By now, you might be wondering, "What's going on? How can one word mean so many different things?" 
Welcome to the world of Toki Pona! The truth is that lots of words are like this in Toki Pona. 
Because the language has such a small vocabulary and is so basic, the ambiguity is inevitable. 
However, this vagueness is not necessarily a bad thing. Because of the vagueness, a speaker of Toki Pona is forced to focus on the very basic, unaltered aspect of things, rather than focusing on many minute details. 

<p>
Another way that Toki Pona is ambiguous is that it <span class="textbf">can not specify</span> whether a word is <span class="textbf">singular</span> or <span class="textbf">plural</span>. 
For example, <span class="textit">jan</span> can mean either "person" or "people". 
If you've decided that Toki Pona is too arbitrary and that not having plurals is simply the final straw, don't be so hasty. 
Toki Pona is not the only language that doesn't specify whether a noun is plural or not. 
Japanese, for example, does the same thing.

<p>
Toki Pona has no Tenses. 
The verbs don't change. 
If it's absolutely necessary, there are ways of saying that something happened in the past, present, or future.
